# Hello scared, confused, and committed geographer

This is our first post on our makeshift webpage to start collecting advice, ideas, ways to navigate the program, etc etc. 

We want to create documentation and a community around how to make geography a more pleasant, fun, and open environment and it all starts with us sharing the knowledge, feelings, and resources we all come to know and learn throughout our varied experiences in the department and beyond. 

More soon!
