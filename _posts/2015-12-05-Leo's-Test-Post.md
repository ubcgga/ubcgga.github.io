Did I do it Joey?  I want to make a new category for us to throw up garbage posts and test out the platform (BlogTests) How do we do it? 
Also - how can we make a stronger physical/human crossover?  How would you respond to this question on the website - like... can you make comments on a post or something? Can you directly answer a post somehow?
