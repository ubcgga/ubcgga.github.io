Did I do it Joey?  I made a new category for us to throw up garbage posts and test out the platform (BlogTests).  We can get rid of it though.  Just wanted somewhere for now.
Also - how can we make a stronger physical/human crossover?  How would you respond to this question? Can you directly answer a post somehow?
